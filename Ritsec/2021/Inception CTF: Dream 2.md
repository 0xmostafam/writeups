Zip file password : Dreamland

## Solution

there is three files after extracting

- A zip file called `TheHotel.7z` that needs a password
- one txt file called `kidnap.txt`
- a powershell file called `kick.ps1`

first lets see the content of `kidnap.txt`

```
An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious. 
52 49 54 53 45 43 7b 57 61 74 65 72 55 6e 64 65 72 54 68 65 42 72 69 64 67 65 7d
```

these look like hexdecimal characters we can use python to decode it

```python
>>> s = "52 49 54 53 45 43 7b 57 61 74 65 72 55 6e 64 65 72 54 68 65 42 72 69 64 67 65 7d"
>>> bytes.fromhex(s).decode('utf-8')
'RITSEC{WaterUnderTheBridge}'
```
