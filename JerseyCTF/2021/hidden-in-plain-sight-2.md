1. try to use cat and grep to find the flag i found two but they were fakes

   ```

2. I though maybe the flag is base64 encoded because the files gives the impression that it is so i encoded the string `jctf` and searched for it

   ```bash
   $ echo "jctf" | base64
   amN0Zgo=
   $ cat flag.txt | grep -i "amN0Z" | base64 -d
   jctf{hips2-b64_c0mes_with_different_equals}
   ```
