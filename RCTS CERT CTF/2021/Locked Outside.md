- Downloading the ove and booting it on virtual box we get this prompt

- typically in any machine the first thing we check for is services/open ports we lets start with a Nmap scan `nmap -T4 -A -p- -vv 10.0.2.14`

```bash

```

- the first thing we see is ftp is open and there is a note.txt and anonymous login is allowed so let's login using `anonymous:anonymous` and get the flag

- note.txt :

```
# Jenkins Development Server
# This is a development server
# default credentials - ssh
# username: root
# password: alpine_r00t
```

- tbh I didn't use these creds maybe they were meant to be used in a different path than the one I took but let's continue opening the http server we see jenkins

- I tried the default creds and it worked `admin:admin`, I tried multiple ways in this [blog](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-web/jenkins) to try and get a shell but most of them failed, the successful one was
  - Create a new project (Freestyle project)
  - Inside Build section set Execute shell and paste a bind shell (reverse shell didn't work for me and since this is a Linux machine we can't use PowerShell)

  - Click Build now
  - Start nc on the attacker machine
  - We have a shell :)

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/FfAxYJn.png)

- Now that we have a shell, we can try to priv escalate to root so let's check `sudo -l` to see what commands we can run at root

```bash
sudo -l
User jenkins may run the following commands on lockedout:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
```

- since we can run vim using sudo, according to gtfobins we can priv escalate using this command `sudo vim -c ':!/bin/ash'`

![](https://i.imgur.com/uZ3v07l.png)

- since we are successfully pwned the machine we can check for the flag but `/root` and `/home` is empty since the description said that their ssh access was blocked we can check ssh config file located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and if we try to cat it we can see that the flag is located there.
