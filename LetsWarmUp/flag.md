# Description

If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?  
Hint 1 : Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

# Solution

change the number to decimal first  
[ 0x70 = 112 ]  
and look for it in a ASCII table
